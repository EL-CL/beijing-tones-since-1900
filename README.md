## Data structure

Each `.csv` file contains the following fields:

- `Item`: This field has values when samples are from different sections (items/chapters/speakers) of the source.
- `Character`: Chinese character corresponding to each syllable (if applicable).
- `Pinyin`: Pinyin (without tone mark) of each syllable (if applicable). Note that some readings differ from today’s standard Putonghua.
- `Tone`: Tone number of each syllable.
- `Duration`: Duration (in ms, except Chao 1922c) of each syllable.
- `P1` to `P30`: Fundamental frequencies (in Hz) of 30 evenly distributed measurement points over the duration of each syllable.

## Notes

- Karlgren (1915) used original units for duration and fundamental frequency. They have been converted into general units (ms and Hz).
- Chao (1922c) and Pai (1934) used semitones as the unit of pitch. For consistency, their data have been converted to Hz based on the standard pitch A = 435 Hz at the time.
- Chao (1922c) did not include absolute duration. Duration values in `1922c Chao.csv` represent the duration ratio of each tone to T2.
- In each syllable in Liu (1925), 4 or more points at the start and 6 or more points at the end should be discarded as they are superfluous pitch bends rather than parts of the actual pitch contour. Liu (1925: 76–78) also disregarded these bends. The durations should also be reduced by one third or more.
- Data of Lin et al. (1998) are already averaged from multiple syllables for each tone, and have only 10 points of fundamental frequency per tone.
- In Sanders & Shi (2003), half of Tone 3 syllables are with creak and a noticeable pitch contour disconnect in the middle. Such samples are marked as `3C` in `Tone` for reference.
